# PromptForge: Future Feature Ideas

This document tracks potential new features and improvements for the PromptForge application. We can implement these when ready.

### 1. "Collections" for Project-Based Organization

*   **The Idea:** Right now, you can filter by tags, which is great for finding individual components. A "Collections" feature would let you group multiple components together into a saved set. For example, you could have a collection called "Sci-Fi Character" that contains specific hairstyles, armor, weapons, and backgrounds that all fit that theme.

*   **Why it would be useful:** This would be a massive time-saver for recurring projects or styles. Instead of re-selecting the same dozen components every time, you could load an entire collection into the Builder with a single click. It adds another layer of organization on top of tags.

### 2. "Inspiration Mode": A Random Prompt Generator

*   **The Idea:** Add a button in the Builder view called "Inspire Me" or "Randomize." When clicked, it would randomly pick a few components from your library (e.g., one `pose`, one `hairstyle`, one `art style`) and assemble them into a new, unexpected prompt.

*   **Why it would be useful:** This is a perfect tool for breaking creative block. Sometimes the best ideas come from unusual combinations you wouldn't have thought of yourself. It would add an element of fun and discovery to the app. You could even add controls to let the user specify *how many* random components to pull.

### 3. Import / Export Your Library

*   **The Idea:** Add simple "Import" and "Export" buttons. The export button would save your entire library (all images, prompts, tags, etc.) as a single JSON file to your computer. The import button would let you load a library from one of those files.

*   **Why it would be useful:** This is a crucial feature for two reasons:
    1.  **Backup & Peace of Mind:** Since everything is stored in the browser's LocalStorage, it could be accidentally deleted if you clear your cache. This gives you a way to back up your hard work.
    2.  **Sharing:** You could share your curated component libraries with friends or other artists!
